# LungCancerClassification_2324

This project was conducted as part of the [Laboratório de IACD](https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/en/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=529878) course, involving the collaborative efforts of [Antónia Brito](https://github.com/Nia3324?tab=followers), [António Cardoso](https://github.com/ToniCardosooo), [Bárbara Santos](https://github.com/barbara-san), Inês Cardoso.

In essence, our objective was to employ Computerized Tomography (CT) images sourced from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC-IDRI) for the creation of machine learning models. Specifically, we aimed to predict the presence or absence of malignant nodules in new CT scans.

The CT scans were sourced from the publicly available LIDC-IDRI dataset, and we employed Python libraries such as pylidc and pyradiomics to extract pertinent features and labels. These features and labels were subsequently utilized to train diverse machine learning algorithms.
